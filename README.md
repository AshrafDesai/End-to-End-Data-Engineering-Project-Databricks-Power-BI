# End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Project-Databricks-Power-BI
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Data Engineering pipeline using Databricks (Lakehouse Architecture) and Power BI. The pipeline follows the Bronze–Silver–Gold (Medallion) architecture, transforming raw data into analytics-ready tables and finally into an interactive business dashboard.
